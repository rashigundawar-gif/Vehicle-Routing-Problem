# ⚙️ Algorithms Used

## 1️⃣ Nearest Neighbor

Starts from the depot and repeatedly visits the nearest unvisited node.

### Advantages
- Fast execution
- Easy implementation

### Limitations
- May not produce optimal routes

---

## 2️⃣ Greedy Insertion

Builds routes incrementally by inserting nodes at positions causing minimum increase in distance.

### Advantages
- Better route quality
- Efficient for medium-sized datasets

### Limitations
- Can get trapped in local optimum

---

## 3️⃣ Genetic Algorithm

Uses evolutionary principles such as selection, crossover, and mutation to optimize routes.

### Advantages
- High-quality solutions
- Suitable for large datasets

### Limitations
- Higher computation time

---
